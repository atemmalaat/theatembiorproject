## 👋 About

This is a living digital portfolio showcasing my passion projects and the mission behind **MadeByKings** and **TheSearchersPodcast** — creative platforms for telling powerful, purpose-driven stories through sport, media, and community.

The site highlights 3 core projects:

- **Slim Reapers Basketball** — an AAU-style team I’ve coached, focused on discipline, brotherhood, and providing young athletes with opportunities to grow on and off the court.
- **The Searchers Podcast** — a podcast exploring culture, faith, creativity, and modern life. Real talk, honest takes, and meaningful conversations.
- **MadeByKings YouTube Channel** — a growing media brand focused on storytelling, motivation, interviews, and content that makes you think (and laugh).

## 🎯 Mission

> “Everyone — and every business — has a story. My goal is to tell that story in a way that matters.”

This project merges my creative skillset, technical learning, and community work into a single digital space I can share with sponsors, supporters, and potential employers. It’s also a sandbox where I’m leveling up my frontend skills.
